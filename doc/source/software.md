## ðŸ’¾ Microcontroller Firmware

The heart of the electronic load is the custom firmware running on its ATmega328P microcontroller.

The firmware is written in C++ and was developed using **Visual Studio Code** with the **PlatformIO** extension. This setup is recommended as it simplifies managing the project's libraries and build configurations. While it's possible to adapt the project for other environments like the Arduino IDE, using PlatformIO is the most straightforward path.

### Programming Options

There are two methods to upload the firmware to the microcontroller:

- **USB**

    This is the simplest method and uses the [Micro USB port](hardware-design.md#fig:back-panel-wireframe) on the back panel. This connection utilizes the onboard [converter board](hardware-design.md#fig:converter-board) to communicate with the microcontroller's TX/RX pins.

    !!! warning
        This method will only work if the ATmega328P microcontroller already has an Arduino-compatible bootloader installed.

- **ICSP Programmer**

    This method programs the microcontroller directly. It is the primary way to:

    - Upload firmware to a microcontroller that does not have a bootloader.
    - Burn a bootloader onto the microcontroller, which then enables the simpler USB programming method.

    This method offers two key advantages over using a bootloader. First, it frees up flash memory, which can be helpful given the memory constraints of the ATmega328P. Second, it reduces the device's startup time, as the firmware runs immediately on power-up instead of waiting for the bootloader's timeout period.

    The [main board](hardware-design.md#pcbs) includes a standard 6-pin ICSP (In-Circuit Serial Programming) header for connecting an external programmer, such as a **USBasp**.

    !!! note "Uploading with ICSP erases the bootloader"
        When you upload firmware directly using an ICSP programmer, it overwrites the entire flash memory of the microcontroller, including the bootloader. If you want to use the USB method again later, you will need to re-burn the bootloader using the ICSP programmer.

    To use this method with PlatformIO, you must add the following configuration to your `platformio.ini` file:

    ```ini
    upload_protocol = custom
    upload_port = usb
    upload_flags = 
        -C
        ${platformio.packages_dir}/tool-avrdude/avrdude.conf
        -p
        $BOARD_MCU
        -P
        $UPLOAD_PORT
        -c
        usbasp
    upload_command = avrdude $UPLOAD_FLAGS -U flash:w:$SOURCE:i
    ```

### Calibration Procedure

!!! tip "Video Guide Available"
    A complete video guide is available on YouTube. It provides a full walkthrough of the calibration procedure, including the required hardware setup, modifying the firmware, and using the on-screen menu.

    [Watch the calibration guide here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx0t7Ovq4uw&t=114s)

To ensure both measurement (ADC) and setpoint (DAC) accuracy, a calibration routine is included in the firmware.
This procedure only needs to be performed once, as the resulting calibration values are stored permanently in the microcontroller's EEPROM.

!!! info "Memory Limitation"
    Due to the limited flash memory on the ATmega328P, the calibration function is disabled by default to make space for all the primary operating modes. You must temporarily modify the source code to access it.

Follow these steps to enable the calibration mode:

1.  **Enable the Calibration Menu:** In the `main.cpp` source file, find and uncomment the `case '6'` block for the calibration function:

    ```cpp
    case '6':
        calibration(lcd, userInput, keypad, encoder, measurements, controls);
        displayMenu(lcd);
        break;
    ```

2.  **Disable Another Mode:** To free up enough memory, you must temporarily comment out another mode. For example, you can disable the **Transient Response Mode**:

    ```cpp
    
    // case '4':
    //    transientResponseMode(lcd, userInput, keypad, encoder, measurements, controls, transient);
    //    displayMenu(lcd);
    //    break;
    ```

3.  **Upload and Calibrate:** Compile and upload the modified firmware. The calibration menu will now be accessible by pressing `6` in the main menu of the load.

!!! danger "Important"
    After you have completed the calibration, you **must** revert these changes (re-comment the calibration block and un-comment the mode you disabled) and re-upload the firmware to restore full functionality.

## PC Application

![PC app](img/desktop-app-battery-discharge.png)

Written in C++ with Qt, the application allows:

- Starting/stopping the load
- Setting current and cutoff voltage
- Monitoring voltage, current, and battery capacity
- Saving graphs as JPG or CSV
- Multi-language UI: English, Polish, German

Communication with the load is via USB using a serial port.
